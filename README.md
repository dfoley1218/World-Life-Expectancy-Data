# World-Life-Expectancy-Data
SQL project focusing on world life expectancy data sets.

Working in healthcare following the pandemic had opened my eyes to the incredible nature of data analysis in regards global health data sets. I became fascinated with how global health data can be used to analyze, predict, and model various outcomes for events such as a worldwide pandemic. Naturally, this led me to choose some of the most up to date world life expectancy data as a playground to hone my SQL skills. Below are a handful of questions I was able to answer utilizing SQL, and there are dozens if not hundreds of more insights that can be gained from these data.

- which countries had the greatest and least life expectancy over the 15 year period?
- Which countries had the largest difference, or greatest change in life expectancies?
- Which year had the average greatest increase?
- What is the average life expectancy between statuses of nations?
- What is the correlation between BMI compared to each country and average life expectancy?
- What is the correlation between adult mortality rates compared to life expectancy?
